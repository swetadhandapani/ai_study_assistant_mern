# ai_study_assistant_mern
**This is a mock project for learning DevOps with MERN Stack.**


A full-stack **MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)** application integrated with **Docker**, **GitHub Actions CI/CD**, and deployed on **AWS EC2**.  
This project demonstrates modern DevOps automation — from local development to cloud deployment.

## 🚀 Summary

This repository hosts a complete **AI Study Assistant** built on the MERN stack with containerized environments and automated deployment pipelines.  
It includes:
- A responsive React frontend  
- A secure Node.js/Express backend  
- MongoDB for data persistence  
- CI/CD setup via GitHub Actions for continuous integration and delivery
